## Live Structure From Motion

This is a basic implementation of (limited) structure from motion that can be run live. It assumes that the user is looking for a specific shape of something (spheres, for example). The structure is simply a generation of relative distances between detected objects. The video requires good features to be able to generate good rotation and translation between frames.
