EVENTUALLY REMOVE THIS FILE, it's for half-baked development ideas,
long-term important concepts ought to be in the README.md


front end to find the points of interest for a current frame
should be replaceable

get the transformation using features associated with respective frames
get 3d locations of points relative to eachother
feature generation and matching ought to be replaceable

need to associate points between frames
perhaps cycle through each possible association, use disparity, and look at distances, associate based on distances... what if you have not 3d positions to associate with? there must be an alternative method to look at image-frame distances from very recent frames.

update the distances. each frame will produce the distances relative to that camera, these can be converted to be relative to each-other with one of them being 0.0. so ultimately, they are stored relative to eachother



need a way to trigger a reset if the balls move
need a smart way to manage feature tracking across many frames, and updating this, along with performing disparity estimates from every combination of frames.... needs more thougths
