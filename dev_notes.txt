EVENTUALLY REMOVE THIS FILE, it's for half-baked development ideas,
long-term important concepts ought to be in the README.md


features are to be tracked across (every?) frame.
every N frames will be a keyframe with a transformation back to the original
a given keyframe can previous and following (N-1)*2 images to find (N-1)*2 measurements
of all valid balls in frame  - which are then transformed back into original
frame then least squares (perhaps weighted by inverse distance of transformation)

going across each frame, track features across each one, eliminating bad ones
when a keyframe idx is reached:
-find sphere locations and save with keyframe idx
-generate rotation/translation to nearby keyframes
-find multiple sets of measurements in current keyframe coordinates of in-frame spheres
-generate the rotation/translation back to original



need to associate sphere points between frames
use roi?
use disparity and 3d positions?
use combination?



need a way to trigger a reset if the balls move
